                            <p>
                                To start the project, I came up with the idea of creating an action 2D platformer due to
                                my familiarity with the Unity engine and the experience I got from the first game I
                                built.
                                After getting a rough idea and concept that I wanted to create, I next looked at some
                                free game assets on Unity's asset store. The asset pack that I chose was the Sunny Land
                                asset pack, which was used for the background and level design of the game.
                                After getting the assets imported into the Unity engine, I started to code the basic
                                movement of the main character. Once that was accomplished, I next used Unity's 2D tile
                                map feature to design the level. This led to the creation of the dock, village, and cave
                                on the level.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="project-header-four">Charaters</h4>
                            <p>
                                During the game jam, I wanted to be creative and create two of the characters from
                                scratch. For there, I turned to the open-source drawing software Krita to draw the main
                                character and the blacksmith. Krita is unique since it had a built-in animator that
                                helped me animate the player attacking, walking, and idle state.
                                Once the characters had been drawn and animated, it was time to create the first level.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="project-header-four">Intro Level</h4>
                            <p>
                                The goal was a short introductory level where the player could get adjusted to the
                                movement mechanics and the basic story. Due to time, I decided to use the same level design for the second level as well.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="project-header-four">Health Bar</h4>
                            <p>
                                For the health bar, I created an empty container with a red bar inside of it. When the
                                player walked over the enemy sprite, it would decrease the health value associated with
                                the container. When the scene switches to the second level or it refreshes, the scene
                                displays the health bar and sets the initial health bar to the maximum level.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="project-header-four">Enemies</h4>
                            <p>
                                For the enemies, I decided to go with the possum sprite that came with the sunny land
                                asset pack due to a lack of time. For the enemy AI, I coded it to infinitely move in one
                                direction and flip after a certain time. When the timer in the sprite is up, the
                                sprite's direction will be flipped and moved in the opposite direction. This way I could
                                have different speeds and timers to fit the versatile design of the level and the
                                weeklong time constraint.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="project-header-four">Story Logic</h4>
                            <p> Lastly, I coded the story logic to transition the first level to the second level and
                                the final ending of the game. To accomplish this, I detected if the player sprite is
                                inside of the story object and transition to the next scene. </p>
